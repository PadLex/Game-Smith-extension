// Hexaris: This game combines elements of Hexagonal Go, Yavalath, and Nine Men's Morris. It is played on a hexagonal board, consisting of concentric hexagonal layers. Players alternate turns placing a piece of their color on an empty intersection. The goal is to make three-in-a-rows, similar to Nine Men's Morris. Once a player achieves a three-in-a-row, they can remove one of the opponent's pieces, following the removal rules of Nine Men's Morris. However, to prevent immediate capture, an opponent's piece must not be part of a three-in-a-row formation. Once all pieces are placed, players take turns moving their pieces to an adjacent empty intersection. If a player forms a three-in-a-row during the moving phase, they can remove one of the opponent's pieces as before.
