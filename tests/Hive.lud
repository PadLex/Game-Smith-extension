//Hive is a two-player abstract strategy game played on a boardless hexagonal grid. Each player possesses an identical set of hexagonal tiles representing various insects: a queen bee, spiders, beetles, grasshoppers, and ants. Players take turns either placing a tile onto the board or moving an existing one. Tiles must initially be placed adjacent to another of the same color, except for the very first tile. Each insect has its unique movement: the queen bee moves one space, spiders move three spaces, beetles move one space and can stack atop other tiles, grasshoppers jump in a straight line over tiles, and ants move any number of spaces around the perimeter. The hive, the interconnected group of tiles, must remain continuous; moves that would split it are not allowed. Tiles adjacent to an opponent's tile are "pinned" and cannot move, barring beetles which can climb over them. The objective is to surround the opponent's queen bee on all six sides. The first player to do so wins.
