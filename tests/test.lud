// Dreamland Duet: Dreamland Duet is a unique combination of Half Chess, Madelinette, and Kharebga. It is played on a 6x9 board and includes modified rules from each of the three games. Players take turns placing one of their colored pieces on any empty cell on the board. The objective is to capture the opponent's pieces and strategically block their moves to achieve victory. Like in Madelinette, each player has a different set of pieces with different movement patterns. Additionally, like in Kharebga, capturing the opponent's pieces is an essential part of the game. The game incorporates elements from Half Chess by utilizing a 6x9 board and excluding pawns. The first player to either capture all of the opponent's powerful pieces or completely block their moves wins the game.
